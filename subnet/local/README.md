# Subnet Local Deployment

This README is an extension of the README in the upper /subnet directory.
The purpose of this directory is for locally hosting subnet with multiple nodes.

1. Build a local docker image with `./build_local_img.sh`. You can use `./build_local_img.sh <branch name>` to build from a differrent subnet branch. 

2. In `docker-compose.yml` you can specify the image you require. For example, `localbuild-subnet:latest` - from step 1, `xinfinorg/xdcsubnets:latest` - latest master build, or another local build image.

3. The `docker-compose.yml` provided is made for an example of 3 subnet nodes which can be increased as needed(requires new genesis file).

4. ~~`docker-compose up bootnode` start bootnode first to get bootnode URL and put in `.env` files. Other configs of the `genesis.json` and `.env` files are already pre-configured.~~ 
Bootnode doesn't work as expected. It doesn't care about `enode_id` if just the IP+port is correct, the communication will work. So this step can be skipped.


5. `docker-compose up` start the rest of the services.


# Subnet Local Debug
* Additionally `./debug/attach` is for troubleshooting node state(of subnet node 1). 
   - The default is `XDPoS.getV2Block()`. If followed by a number like `./debug/attach 100` then it is `XDPoS.getV2Block(100)` returning contents of the 100th block. 
   - If followed by words then it will issue that command, for example `./debug/attach admin.peers` return peers of that node. 
   - Use singe quotes `'` to wrap over commands that doesn't work work eg `./debug/attach 'XDPoS.getV2Block("committed")'`

* `./cleanup.sh` helps with deleting subnet files and the cloned XDC-Subnet directory.

* Sometimes the docker image will fail to launch due to conflicting ports. Use `sudo lsof -i -P` (or `sudo lsof -i -P | grep <PORT>`) to check if the port number in the `docker-compose.env` file is available. In case of conflict, feel free to change the port numbers in the compose file (for bootnode port change, subnets' `.env` file `BOOTNODES` port config also have to change).
