# Subnet
XDC subnet is a blockchain network tailored for private and consortium use cases. It is powered by XDC2.0, which is the core engine of XDC network and enables state-of-the-art security against Byzantine attacks with forensics, fast transaction confirmation, and low energy consumption. It is also designed to enable secure checkpointing to XDC mainnet, so that it can harness the security, finality, and accountability of mainnet.
