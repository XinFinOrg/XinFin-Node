* **If you lose it, all your funds will get locked.**
* After creating backup, Download your Keystore file.
* Now Access your wallet with Keystore and enter a valid password properly to access your wallet.
* If you are hosting a Masternode on Testnet then copy the Wallet address and paste it on **[XDC Faucet](https://faucet.apothem.network/)** for the Testnet XDC
